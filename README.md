# AO3 History Search
this short python script allows you to search your ao3 history for the top stats of any of the provided filters - author, wordcount, fic title, relationship, fandom, rating, warning, viewed, posted, and catagory

## How to use
- scrape your ao3 history using the info from [this reddit post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/zu9f5a/ao3_wrapped_history_spreadsheet_how_to_rip_your/)
- download the python script and open it in any python editor (i use vscode)
- replace this `"change this to your ao3historyspreadsheet filepath"` to your own ao3 spreadsheet filepath
    - make sure you change all the backslashes to forward slashes 
    - "C:\Users\me\Documents\ao3_expanded1.xlsx" becomes "C:/Users/me/Documents/ao3_expanded1.xlsx"
- run the script!

## Dependencies
the script does require you to have python installed on your device, if it isn't it can be installed here.

the script also needs the following python addons:
- [pip] (https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
