## How to use
- scrape your ao3 history using the info from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/zu9f5a/ao3_wrapped_history_spreadsheet_how_to_rip_your/)
- download the python script and open it in any python editor (i use vscode)
- replace this `"change this to your ao3 history spreadsheet filepath"` to your own ao3 spreadsheet filepath
    - make sure you change all the backslashes to forward slashes 
    - "C:\Users\me\Documents\ao3_expanded1.xlsx" becomes "C:/Users/me/Documents/ao3_expanded1.xlsx"
- run the script!
  
## Dependencies
the script does require you to have python installed on your device, if it isn't it can be installed here.

the script also needs the following python addons:
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
- [pyxll](https://pypi.org/project/pyxll/)

#### i made this for my own enjoyment in like an hour so it's not the best script ever but have fun with it!
